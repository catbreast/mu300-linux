# Findings: running Linux on the ZTE F50 / MU300 (Unisoc T760)

Everything below was verified on a ZTE F50 (hardware MU300, firmware `MU300_ZYV1.0.0B09`,
Android 13, stock kernel `5.4.254-android12-9-g9c6342244991`) during September 2026.
Each item lists the symptom, the root cause and the fix, so it can be reused for other
UMS9620 devices (for example the ZTE U30 Air).

## Hardware and firmware facts

| Boot images | boot and vendor_boot are Android header v4, page 4096, LZ4 legacy ramdisks |

## Boot chain and safe testing

### 1. Slot b one-shot trial (never touch boot_a)
* Linux is written to **boot_b** only, and the 32-byte AOSP `bootloader_control` block at
  offset `0x800` of `misc` is set so that slot b has the highest priority.
* **Unisoc LK treats `tries_remaining == 1 && successful_boot == 0` as an already failed boot**
  (`ANDROID: slot 1 booted fail, rolling back spl and reboot into normal`). A one-shot trial therefore
  needs `tries_remaining = 2`: LK decrements it to 1 and boots slot b; if that boot fails, the next boot
  rolls back to slot a.
* Linux `init` writes the original slot-a block back to `misc` as one of its first steps, so any later
  reboot returns to Android.
* The `uboot_log` partition contains LK's ring log. It is the best source for "which slot was chosen" and
  "why did it reset" (`rst_mode`, `charge first poweron reset`, watchdog flags).

### 2. Boot ramdisk must be LZ4 legacy
* Symptom: `RAMDISK: lz4 image found at block 0`, `RAMDISK: incomplete write (-28 != 8388608)`, then
  `VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(1,0)`.
* Cause: vendor_boot's ramdisk is LZ4 legacy; a gzip boot ramdisk appended to it is not unpacked as an
  initramfs by this 5.4 kernel, which then falls back to the legacy `/dev/ram0` image path.
* Fix: compress the boot ramdisk with `lz4 -l`. Also add a `dev/console` node to the cpio.

### 3. Logs without a serial console
* The stock cmdline has `loglevel=1`, so nothing reaches `console-ramoops`.
* pstore only survives a warm reset. Most failures on this device end in a power cut, so init also
  persists its stage list and `dmesg` into unused space inside **boot_b at 48 MiB (8 MiB)**; it is read
  back from Android.
* A USB CDC-ACM function (`acm.GS0`) next to ECM gives a login console on the host
  (`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS) that works even when networking does not.

## Hardware bring-up with the vendor modules

### 4. USB gadget dependency chain
The UDC only appears when the whole chain probes, in this order:
`extcon-usb-gpio` (the PHY node references `extcon-gpio`) → PHYs → `sc27xx_adc` → `sprd_battery_info`
→ `sprd-charger-manager` → `sc27xx_fuel_gauge` → `bq2560x-charger` (provides the `otg-vbus` regulator used as
`vbus-supply` by DWC3 and MUSB) → `dwc3-sprd` / `musb_sprd`.
* **`sc27xx_adc` must be loaded before the fuel gauge.** The vendor `sc27xx-fgu` driver returns a hard error
  (not `-EPROBE_DEFER`) when its IIO channel is missing and is never probed again.
* The exact working order of the 86 modules is in `boot/module-order.txt`.

### 5. The ~290 s power cut (PM co-processor watchdog)
* Symptom: Linux runs normally, then the device loses power about 290 s after boot. LK shows
  `charge first poweron reset`, not a watchdog reset.
* Cause: the PM co-processor (CM4, `pm_sys`) runs its own watchdog. `sprd_pmic_wdt` disarms it by sending
  `watchdog rstoff` over an SIPC sbuf channel, but that channel only becomes ready after Android's
  `modem_control` reloads `pm_sys` (and the modem) through Trusty (`kernelbootcp` TA).
* Fix: run Android's own `/vendor/bin/modem_control` in a chroot with Android's bionic linker and
  libraries. Requirements that were each discovered by failure:
  1. Copy `/dev/__properties__` from a running Android so property reads work.
  2. Create `/dev/block/by-name` links and apply Android's node ownership (`ueventd.rc` plus `chown`/`chmod`
     from vendor `init*.rc`), because `modem_control` drops to uid `system` (1000).
  3. Bind-mount a copy of `/proc/cmdline` with `androidboot.slot_suffix=_a` so it loads the `_a` modem images
     (LK passes `_b` when booting the trial slot).
  4. **Exec the binary directly.** `sprd_modem_loader` rejects every ioctl/write unless `current->comm` is
     exactly `modem_control` (`drivers/unisoc_platform/modem_loader`); running it as
     `linker64 /vendor/bin/modem_control` makes the task name `linker64`.
  5. Provide a sink for liblog (`tools/logdw`, listens on `/dev/socket/logdw`), otherwise the daemon's logs vanish.
* Result: `kbc_verify_all_avb2() ret = 0`, `SEC_KBC_START_CP() ret = 0`,
  `sprd-pmic-wdt: sbuf ready for pmic wdt init!`, `Modem Alive`, and no more power cut.

### 6. Load average of about 12 is not CPU usage
Vendor kernel threads (`sprd-rotation/N`, `sipa-*`, `slog`) wait in `D` state; Linux counts them in the load
average. `top` shows about 98 % idle.

## Custom kernel

### 7. Matching source
* The ZTE U30 Air kernel (`github.com/Enceka/android_kernel_zte_ums9620_mifi_u30air`, "downloaded from ZTE
  opensource") is exactly 5.4.254, covers 137 of the 150 F50 vendor modules and all but one derived config
  symbol of the F50 stock config.
* Missing from that tree: camera/display/GPU/touch modules (not used on this device) and the Wi-Fi driver
  `sprd_wlan_combo`, which is taken from the realme C51/C53 AndroidT kernel_modules drop.
* An older Unisoc 5.4.147 tree lacks the whole qogirn6pro USB stack and is not usable.

### 8. Build notes
* Full LTO needs more than 8 GiB in the linker step; ThinLTO keeps CFI and links fine.
* Stock config + `kernel/mu300-linux.fragment` adds devtmpfs, fhandle, autofs, SysV IPC, namespaces, nftables,
  btrfs/xfs/squashfs, NFS/CIFS, USB serial/modem/audio host drivers, crypto user API, CDC-ACM gadget, and removes
  `STATIC_USERMODEHELPER` and forced module signatures.
* All vendor modules must be rebuilt from the same tree (symbol CRCs change).

## Root filesystem on free eMMC space

### 9. Unused space after userdata
* `userdata` is 20 GiB and ends at sector 54218752; the GPT's last usable LBA is 122155007 and the backup GPT
  is at the very end. About **32.4 GiB between them belongs to no partition** and read back as zeros.
* The rootfs is an ext4 filesystem (`mu300root`) at byte offset `27762098176` (sector 54222848), 32.39 GiB,
  accessed through a loop device with an offset. **The GPT, userdata and all Android partitions are unchanged.**
* `userdata` uses metadata encryption (`dm-default-key`, `inlinecrypt`), so it cannot be shrunk or shared.

### 10. Mounting gotchas
* busybox `mount -o loop,offset=` only creates a loop for regular files; for a block device the options go to
  ext4 and fail with `EINVAL`. Use `losetup -o` and verify `/sys/block/loopN/loop/offset`.
* Android's `losetup -f` can return a loop index whose node does not exist yet; allocate, wait for the node and
  refuse to attach the same offset twice (two loops mounting one ext4 corrupted it once).
* Toybox `od` on 64 MiB is extremely slow; never interrupt a safety check, an interrupted pipeline "passed" once.

## Ubuntu on kernel 5.4

The root filesystem moved from Ubuntu 26.04 to 24.04 LTS: 26.04's userland starts to depend on syscalls newer than
5.4 (below), 24.04 is supported until 2029 and runs on 5.4 without workarounds.

### 11. systemd 259 works on 5.4
5.4 is systemd's minimum baseline; the system boots to `running` with the `old-kernel` taint.

### 12. USB Ethernet must be up before the host activates ECM
* Symptom: macOS shows the "MU300 Linux USB Ethernet" interface as `inactive` forever, no DHCP, although on the
  device `usb0` is UP with carrier.
* Cause: `usb0` was only brought up by a systemd unit a few seconds after the UDC was bound. f_ecm reports the link
  in its first CONNECT notification and macOS' `AppleUserECM` does not pick up a later "connected" notification.
* Fix: `ifconfig usb0 up` immediately after binding the UDC in the initramfs.

### 13. Userland needing newer syscalls
* Ubuntu 26.04's GNU `tar` (1.35+dfsg-4ubuntu0.4) fails with `Cannot stat: Function not implemented` for every
  path, creating and extracting: it resolves paths with `openat2` (Linux 5.6) and has no fallback. 24.04's tar does
  not use `openat2`.
* `ssh.service` is socket-activated (24.04 and 26.04); enable `ssh.socket`, not only `ssh.service`.
* Extracting an archive that contains a `lib/` directory over Ubuntu replaces the `/lib -> usr/lib` symlink with a
  directory (systemd then disappears). Always ship files under `usr/lib/...`.
* `docker export` leaves `/etc/hostname` empty.

### 13b. One reader at a time on the modem's AT tty, and reopen it after a modem restart
`/dev/stty_nr*` are SIPC channels, not real serial ports, and the data goes to **one** reader. While a process
holds the channel, a second one that opens the device reads nothing - it is not broken, it is simply not the owner.

This is what an earlier version of this section got wrong. The observation was "the tty stays silent until the modem
is restarted", and the conclusion was that closing it desynchronises the channel for ever. What actually happens is
the reverse: a descriptor that was open **across a modem restart** (`AT+SFUN=4`, or a CP crash) refers to a channel
that no longer exists, so it reads nothing - and because it still occupies the device, every other opener is shut
out too, which is what made it look permanent. Closing that descriptor and opening the device again fixes it
immediately; no modem restart is needed. Measured: with the daemon holding a stale descriptor, all six channels are
silent; with the daemon stopped, all six answer `OK` at once.

Two rules follow, and `mu300-atd` implements both:

* **Exactly one owner.** The daemon holds the tty and serves one command at a time through a pair of fifos in
  `/run/mu300-at`; `mu300-at "AT+CSQ"` asks it, and `mobile-data` uses it automatically when it is running. Nothing
  else may open the device - including `stty -F`, which is an open and a close of its own.
* **Reopen when the modem goes quiet.** After two unanswered commands the daemon reopens the device and retries
  once, which is all a modem restart needs.

Also make sure only one bring-up runs at a time: `mobile-data up` from the service and from the watchdog used to
run concurrently, and the two of them take the channel lock away from each other for every single AT command, so
neither finishes. `mobile-data` now holds `/run/mu300-mobile-data-up.lock` while it works.

Verified on 5.4 after these changes: a full `down`/`up` cycle followed by AT queries, and 12 queries over two
minutes with the watchdog polling at the same time - all answered, no reopen needed.

### 13c. Reading this tty needs `read -t`, and only bash or busybox ash have it
Two ways of timing out a read do **not** work here, and both fail silently:

* **dash has no `read -t`.** It is `/bin/sh` on Ubuntu and Debian, so a `#!/bin/sh` script using `read -t` fails on
  every read with "Illegal option", spins through its timeout and returns an empty reply. The symptom is a daemon
  that answers nothing while burning exactly one timeout of CPU per command (measured: 17.9 s for three 6 s
  commands).
* **The termios timer is ignored.** `stty min 0 time 5` changes nothing: the driver blocks in `sbuf_read` until the
  modem says something, possibly for ever. Visible as `wchan = sbuf_read` with zero CPU time.

`read -t` in bash and in busybox ash uses `poll()`, which this driver does implement, so both work. `mu300-atd` and
`mu300-at` re-exec themselves under bash (or busybox ash) when the shell running them has no `-t`.

Apply `stty` to the already-open descriptor (`stty raw -echo <&3`), never `stty -F /dev/stty_nr1`: the `-F` form is
an extra open and close of the device, which takes the channel away from whoever owns it (13b).

## Wi-Fi (SC2355 / Marlin3)

### 14. Bring-up
* Modules: `pcie-sprd-misc`, `pcie-sprd`, `wcn_bsp`, `sprd_wlan_combo`.
* Firmware and board config come from Android's `/odm/firmware`: `wcnmodem.bin`, `gnssmodem.bin`,
  `wifi_board_config.ini`, `wifi_board_config_ab.ini`. Place them in `/usr/lib/firmware`.
* The realme `wlan_combo` driver falls back to `wifi_board_config_hulk.ini` for unknown projects; the firmware then
  asserts with `CMD_DOWNLOAD_INI / LOAD_INI_DATA_FAILED` and the chip stays in "card dump" state, so `wlan0` cannot
  be brought up (`RTNETLINK answers: No such device`). `kernel/patches/wlan_combo-default-board-config.patch` fixes it.
* `rmmod wcn_bsp` crashes the kernel; reboot instead of reloading the Wi-Fi stack.
* The driver logs `API version not match` for a few command IDs (the realme driver is slightly older than the ZTE
  firmware) and a `WARNING` in `sc2355_free_cmd_buf` (spin_unlock_bh in IRQ context).
* Verified after the fix: the driver parses `wifi_board_config.ini`, `wlan0` comes up, `iw dev wlan0 scan` lists
  nearby networks and `hostapd` (nl80211, WPA2) reaches `AP-ENABLED`. The MAC address is randomized on each load.
* A crash right after installing a module can leave a 0-byte `.ko` on ext4; run `sync` after installing files.

## Mobile data without Android RIL

### 14b. Wi-Fi station mode: decided at boot, and one way only
The SC2355 can be an access point or a client of somebody else's network, but the switch only goes one way:

* The driver creates `wlan0` in **station** mode. hostapd turns it into an access point, and after that nothing
  turns it back. `iw dev wlan0 set type managed` is refused with `Invalid argument` even with the interface down
  and out of the bridge, although `iw phy phy0 info` lists `managed` among the supported modes.
* Deleting and recreating the interface **breaks the radio until the next reboot**: the driver powers the WCN
  chip down and up through an SDIO path (`WCN BASEstart_marlin SDIO card dump`), which is not how Marlin3 is
  attached on this board, and the result is `sprd-wlan: failed to power on WCN!` on every later open. A second
  interface does not help either - with the first one still present the firmware answers scans with
  `sc2355_scan_timeout`.

So the mode belongs to the boot: `mu300-wifi-client.service` runs before `mu300-hotspot.service`, joins the saved
network while `wlan0` is still a station, and holds `/run/mu300-wifi-client.active`, which the hotspot unit refuses
to start on (`ConditionPathExists=!`). Going back to the hotspot needs no reboot, because that is the direction
hostapd can do by itself.

**WPA3/SAE does not work**: wpa_supplicant negotiates SAE correctly but every association is rejected with
`status_code=1`, so Wi-Fi 7 / WPA3-only networks (a "MLO" SSID, for instance) cannot be joined. WPA2 works;
measured on the device: 18 networks scanned, joined, DHCP address, and the Wi-Fi default route (metric 50) taking
precedence over mobile data (metric 100).

### 15. Radio, registration and the data bearer
* AT channels: `/dev/stty_nr0` carries unsolicited results (URCs); `/dev/stty_nr1` is a clean command channel.
* After `modem_control` boots the modem the radio is off (`+CFUN: 0`). Android's RIL (`libimpl-ril.so`) uses the Unisoc
  commands `AT+SFUN=2` (SIM on) and `AT+SFUN=4` (protocol stack on); afterwards `+CFUN: 1` and the modem registers
  (`+CEREG: 2,1,...,13` = E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity, i.e. 5G NSA).
* The network activates the default EPS bearer (CID 1, IPv4v6) by itself. `AT+CGCONTRDP=1` returns the address as
  `a.b.c.d.m.m.m.m` plus DNS servers. `AT+CGDATA="M-ETHER",1` answers `CONNECT` and binds the bearer to
  `sipa_eth0` (`sipa_eth<cid-1>`, raw IP, `NOARP`). Assign the address as /32 and route `default dev sipa_eth0`.
* Measured on a Turkcell 5G NSA SIM: about 9.3 MB/s download and 1.3 MB/s upload. `rootfs/.../mobile-data` implements
  up/down/status/sim-reset and NAT (`nftables masquerade` + MSS clamping) so USB/Wi-Fi clients can share the link.
* AT responses can arrive after a short read timeout and then show up as answers to the next command. Drain the channel
  before sending and read until the final result code (`OK`, `ERROR`, `+CME ERROR`, `CONNECT`).
* Hot-swapping the SIM leaves it busy (`+CME ERROR: 14`) and registration stays at emergency-only (`+CEREG: 2,8`);
  reboot after changing the SIM.
* A SIM without an active data plan still registers and gets an address; TCP handshakes may even succeed, but no data
  flows. Check the plan before debugging the data path.

### 16. Rootfs details found while testing data
* `docker export` leaves an empty `/etc/resolv.conf`: `resolvectl query` works but glibc programs cannot resolve names.
  Link it to `../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`.
* busybox/toybox tar drop xattrs, so `ping` loses `cap_net_raw`; `mu300-fixups.service` restores it.
* Android's uid `system` (1000) is also Ubuntu's first user, so modem device nodes show up as owned by `ubuntu`.

## Default boot

### 17. Linux as default without losing the Android fallback
* LK decrements `tries_remaining` before booting a slot and rolls back when it finds `tries == 1 && !successful`.
  The one-shot trial arms slot b with `tries = 2`.
* Default-Linux mode never sets `successful_boot`. Instead:
  1. init skips the slot-a restore when `/etc/mu300/default-boot` in the rootfs says `linux` (slot b is left at `tries = 1`);
  2. `mu300-boot-ok.service` runs 30 s after `multi-user.target` and writes the `tries = 2` block again.
* A boot that never reaches `mu300-boot-ok` therefore leaves `tries = 1`, and the next boot rolls back to Android.
* Verified: `mu300-next-boot linux` + reboot returned to Linux and re-armed slot b; `mu300-next-boot android` + reboot
  booted slot a.

## Parity with Android

### 18. Services and drivers Android runs that the minimal port lacked
* `cp_diskserver` persists modem NV (`nr_fixnv*`, `nr_runtimenv*`); on first start it immediately wrote pending
  "dirty" NV data, so without it modem NV changes are lost. `refnotify` handles modem reference-clock requests.
  Both run from the same chroot; `srtd` needs Android's binder radio HAL and is skipped.
* Drivers that load cleanly after the modem is up: `sprd_soc_thm`, `thermal-generic-adc`, `sprd_cpu_cooling` (binds
  cpufreq and CPU hotplug cooling to `soc-thmzone` with trips at 70/85/110 °C), `leds-sc27xx-bltc` (RGB status LED),
  `zte_card_holder_det`, `sc27xx-vibra`, `sprd_cp_dvfs`, `sprd_ddr_dvfs`. `zte_sar` loads but the aw9610x SAR sensor
  is not populated on this board (`-201`).
* Android disables audio entirely (`ro.audioserver.disabled=true`, no sound cards) although the device tree has an
  enabled sound card (`unisoc,vbc-v4-codec-sc2730`), the UMP9620 codec and an AW883xx smart amplifier that answers on I2C.
* Android's hotspot (`WifiConfigStoreSoftAp.xml`) lives on the metadata-encrypted `/data`, so Linux cannot read it; it
  has to be copied while Android runs. No factory default Wi-Fi credential is stored in a readable partition.
* RAM: Android uses about 960 MiB of the 1.4 GiB; Ubuntu with all services about 480 MiB, of which ~100 MiB is
  unreclaimable vendor-driver slab. journald is capped (`RuntimeMaxUse=16M`).

### 19. systemd ordering pitfall
* A unit `Before=ssh.socket` that keeps default dependencies is ordered after `basic.target`, while `ssh.socket` is
  before `sockets.target` (before `basic.target`). systemd silently drops `ssh.socket` from the boot transaction and SSH
  never starts. Units that must run before sockets need `DefaultDependencies=no`.

### 20. Diagnosing early power cuts
* The initramfs log loop ends at `switch_root` and journald flushes only after local filesystems are up, so a power cut in
  the first seconds of systemd leaves no log. `mu300-early-recorder.service` keeps writing `dmesg` to the boot_b log area
  for the first five minutes.

## LAN, Wi-Fi bands and regulatory

### 21. One LAN for USB and Wi-Fi
* `br-lan` (192.168.77.1/24) bridges `usb0` and `wlan0`; one dnsmasq serves both.
* cfg80211 refuses to bridge `wlan0` ("Device does not allow enslaving to a bridge") because `IFF_DONT_BRIDGE` stays set:
  the SC2355 driver marks the interface as AP but returns an error from `change_virtual_intf` when tearing down the
  previous firmware mode fails, so cfg80211 skips clearing the flag. `kernel/patches/wlan_combo-allow-bridging-ap.patch`.
* After moving modules, delete old copies: `depmod` indexes every subdirectory and `modprobe` loaded stale drivers from
  an `extra.old/` directory for several boots.

### 22. Regulatory database
* This 5.4 kernel only has the `sforshee` regdb certificate; current `wireless-regdb` is signed by `wens`, so
  `iw reg reload` fails with `-ENODATA`, the domain stays `00` and 5 GHz is `NO-IR`. Android's own `regulatory.db` is
  signed by a different certificate and is rejected too. `kernel/patches/regdb-wens-certificate.patch` adds mainline's
  `wens.hex`. cfg80211 tries to load the database before the rootfs is mounted, so userspace runs `iw reg reload` first.

### 23. Only one AP; 5 GHz AP needs the DS Parameter Set element
* `iw list`: `#{ managed, AP } <= 1` — only one AP interface, so 2.4 and 5 GHz cannot be served simultaneously.
* Symptom: with hostapd on channel 36 the firmware answered `CMD_START_AP` with `SPRD_CMD_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORT_ERROR`
  (HT/VHT), or accepted it and never sent beacons (non-HT), for every country, channel, rate set and HT/VHT/PMF setting
  tried. Android's SoftAP on the same firmware runs on 5180 MHz with 80 MHz.
* Stock (ZTE) and realme `sc2355_start_ap` are identical, so the command payload was captured on Android with a kprobe
  on `sc2355_send_cmd_recv_rsp` (`msg->data` at +24, command id at data-11). Android's beacon contains a DS Parameter Set
  element (`03 01 24`) on 5 GHz — Unisoc's hostapd adds it — while upstream hostapd only adds it on 2.4 GHz. The
  firmware takes the AP channel from that element.
* `kernel/patches/wlan_combo-5ghz-ap-ds-params.patch` inserts the element when hostapd omits it. Verified: 802.11a/n/ac
  AP on channel 36 at 80 MHz (seen by a client, disappears when hostapd stops). The firmware offers 5 GHz AP only on
  36-48 and 149-165 (its ACS channel list); `hotspot-start` uses HT40/VHT80 there, and `hotspot-verify` still falls back
  to 2.4 GHz if the firmware refuses.
* The wiphy rate table lists HT MCS rates as legacy bitrates, so hostapd advertises odd "extended rates" (some with the
  basic-rate bit); Android does the same and the firmware ignores them.
* hostapd's 20/40 MHz coexistence scan (`HT_SCAN`) completes on this driver; the log line after it can lag because
  hostapd's stdout is block-buffered.
* The stock driver prints the SoftAP passphrase to the kernel log (`vendor_softap_convert_para`); Android `dmesg`
  captures contain it.

### 26. Modem resets and mobile data recovery
* The modem firmware occasionally resets: it sends an smsg (type 12, "channel 0 not opened" on the AP side),
  `sipa_delegate: modem_reset`, and `modem_control` stops and reloads the modem through Trusty. It comes back with
  `+CFUN: 0`, no registration and no PDP context, while `sipa_eth0` keeps its stale address, so clients lose internet.
  Android's RIL reconnects silently.
* `mobile-data watch` (`mu300-mobile-data-watch.service`) checks `AT+CGACT?` and the interface address every 30 s and
  runs `up` again after two failed checks; `mobile-data down` sets `/run/mu300-mobile-data-down` so a manual disconnect
  is respected. Verified by switching the radio off: data returned without intervention.

### 27. Where the missing ~550 MiB of RAM goes
* `Memory: 1430144K/2097084K available ... 617788K reserved`. The device tree reserves 464 MiB for the modem firmware
  (`cp-modem@88000000`, needed for 4G/5G), 24 MiB for Trusty (`tos-mem`), 8 MiB SIPC shared memory, 3 MiB DDR training
  data and a few small areas; the kernel image (~35 MiB) and the page tables for 2 GiB (~32 MiB) make up the rest.
  `cma_share` (48 MiB) is still usable for movable pages.
* Not needed on Linux: `logobuffer` (9 MiB, there is no display) and `sysdump-uboot` (16 MiB, bootloader crash dumps).
  `kernel/patches/of-reserved-mem-skip.patch` adds `CONFIG_OF_RESERVED_MEM_SKIP` (the boot image command line is not
  passed on by LK, so a cmdline option alone would not work); MemTotal grew from 1447 to 1473 MiB.
* `mu300-zram.service` adds lz4 zram swap of half the RAM (swappiness 100).


### 28. Mali-G57 GPU (OpenCL) without Android
* The stock `mali_kbase.ko` (DDK r40p0) does not load: 166 of its 335 imported symbol CRCs differ from this kernel.
  realme's `kernel_modules` master branch has the same DDK (`gpu/natt/mali`, r40p0-01eac0, UK 11.36, platform
  `qogirn6pro`); an older checkout of the tree has r34p0 (UK 11.31), which Android's r40p0 userspace would not accept.
  `kernel/build-mali.sh` builds it; it probes `23140000.gpu` as "arch 9.0.9 r0p1" and creates `/dev/mali0`.
* Userspace is Android's `libGLES_mali.so` (it is also `libOpenCL.so` and the Vulkan ICD), a bionic library with a
  37-library closure (VNDK apex, bionic, gralloc/mapper HIDL stubs). It runs in the existing vendor chroot with
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` covering vendor, egl, VNDK and bionic; `/dev/ion` is enough for OpenCL buffers.
* Test programs are built for bionic with plain clang (`--target=aarch64-linux-android29`, linked against the device's
  `libc.so`/`libdl.so`/`libOpenCL.so`) and a small `_start` that calls `__libc_init` (`tools/gpu/`), so no NDK is needed.
  `android-gpu-run /system/bin/cltest`: "OpenCL 3.0 v1.r40p0-01eac0", device "Mali-G57 r0p1", 4M-element kernel
  verified correct.
* There is no display, so GLES/Vulkan are only usable off-screen. The driver adds about 45 MiB of memory use.

## OpenWrt

### 29. OpenWrt 25.12 next to Ubuntu
* Layout: the ext4 area holds `/openwrt` (and `/ubuntu`, or Ubuntu directly in the root on first installs);
  `/.mu300/boot-os` selects the system and `init` starts `/lib/systemd/systemd` or procd's `/sbin/init`. The disk stays
  mounted at `/mnt/mu300-disk`; `mu300-os ubuntu|openwrt` switches. `openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` builds the rootfs from the
  official armsr/armv8 tarball (checksum-verified) with apk, our kernel modules flat in `/lib/modules/<release>`
  (ubox kmodloader), the vendor chroot and procd services (`mu300-vendor`, `mu300-hw`, `mu300-post`).
* Cellular WAN is a netifd protocol (`proto mu300cell`, option `apn`), so LuCI/fw4 handle routing, DNS and NAT;
  `mobile-data watch` calls `ifup wan` after modem resets.
* Pitfalls found on the device:
  * procd mounts `/dev` as a 512 KiB tmpfs: copying the 85 MiB Android property area gives empty files and
    `modem_control` never boots the modem (power cut at ~290 s). The property area is now bind-mounted (also on Ubuntu,
    saving the RAM).
  * procd preloads `/lib/libsetlbf.so` into services; the chroot runners unset `LD_PRELOAD` or the bionic linker fails.
  * `ujail` drops capability 38 (CAP_PERFMON), unknown to 5.4, so jailed services crash-loop; `procd-ujail` is removed.
  * OpenWrt's busybox lacks `od`, `timeout`, `losetup`, `telnetd`; the static busybox provides them, plus a tiny
    `mountpoint` script (neither busybox has it).
  * GNU `stty` fails on the modem tty ("unable to perform all requested operations"); it is non-fatal now.
  * `wifi`/netifd wireless handlers are in `wifi-scripts` (with `iwinfo`, `wireless-regdb`), not pulled in by `wpad`.
  * macOS keeps the ECM link inactive after netifd reconfigures `usb0`; a hotplug hook re-enumerates the gadget on every
    LAN ifup.
  * The kernel had no nftables sets (`CONFIG_NF_TABLES_SET`), so fw4's ruleset (`ct state vmap {...}`) was rejected as a
    whole and there was no NAT; the fragment now enables sets, objref, flow offload, redirect, quota and friends.
  * OpenWrt's `regulatory.db` is unsigned; this kernel wants the signed one (Debian's `wireless-regdb`).
  * cfg80211 requests `regulatory.db` at 1.6 s, before the rootfs exists; the direct load fails and the request sits in the
    sysfs firmware fallback for 60 s (no userspace helper answers it, neither on OpenWrt nor with systemd-udevd), and
    `iw reg reload` returns ENOENT meanwhile. `regdb-load` answers the pending requests through `/sys/class/firmware`,
    then reloads; the country is applied before netifd starts hostapd.
  * Attended sysupgrade ("Check online for firmware upgrades") and `sysupgrade` would flash a whole-disk armsr image
    (own GPT, kernel 6.12) over the eMMC and brick the device. The packages are removed and `/sbin/sysupgrade` only allows
    configuration backups.
  * `wifi-scripts` generates an open "OpenWrt" network on first boot; `openwrt-wifi-config` replaces it once (marker
    `/etc/mu300/wifi-configured`) with the imported SSID/WPA2 settings.
* Verified after reboots: 5 GHz AP (channel 36), cellular WAN, a USB client's traffic leaves with the modem's public IP;
  memory use about 140 MiB.
* The early recorder runs from preinit, so a failed OpenWrt boot leaves dmesg, `ps`, `logread` and the Android logcat in
  boot_b for `tools/collect-logs.sh`.


### 30. Installer notes
* Android's `/system/bin/sh` (mksh) does 32-bit arithmetic: byte offsets of the Linux region (27 GiB) overflow, so the
  device script works in sectors. mksh also lets a failing EXIT trap replace the exit status; the installer checks for an
  explicit success line instead.
* `adb shell`/`exec-out` read stdin and swallow answers piped into a script; every call uses `</dev/null`.
* Android restarts once shortly after booting back from a Linux fallback; start the installer when Android has settled.
* A first-generation install (Ubuntu directly in the filesystem root) is replaced by `/ubuntu`; `init` still boots the
  old layout if no `/ubuntu` exists.

## Audio

### 24. No internal audio hardware
* The DT enables a sound card, the UMP9620 codec and an AW883xx amplifier at `6-0034`, and Android disables audio.
  With `i2c-dev`, nothing answers at 0x34 (nor at the bq2560x address 0x6b), and there is no AGDSP firmware partition.
  The board has no speaker path; only Bluetooth or USB-host audio devices are possible.
* Update: community Android modules show the audio DSP itself is usable. The F50 DT has `audiocp_boot` and `sound@0` but
  no `audio-mem`/`audiodsp-mem` reserved memory (another UMS9620 device uses 0xaf700000 3 MiB and 0xafa00000 6 MiB).
  Their flow loads an AGDSP image taken from a different device into `/sys/devices/platform/audiocp_boot/agdsp`
  (`stop`, write, `start`), binds `sound@0` to `vbc-rxpx-codec-sc27xx`, and gets a `sprdphone-sc2730` card with Bluetooth
  SCO call audio. The Unisoc ASoC/AGDSP driver sources are in the realme `unisoc-5.4` kernel_modules tree; porting this
  to Linux is future work (A2DP over BlueZ does not need the DSP).

## Bluetooth

### 25. SC2355 Bluetooth on BlueZ
* Transport: `sprdbt_tty` (realme `wcn/bluetooth/driver/tty-pcie`, built with `BSP_BOARD_UNISOC_WCN_SOCKET=pcie`) exposes
  an H4 tty `/dev/ttyBT0` over the WCN PCIe link and registers a `bluetooth` rfkill that powers the BT function.
  `btattach -B /dev/ttyBT0 -P h4` creates `hci0`.
* Vendor init (Android `libbt-sprd_suite`, Marlin3): before the stack starts, send `0xFCA0` with the 176-byte PSKey block
  from `bt_configure_pskey.ini` (BD address at bytes 20..25, little endian), `0xFCA2` with the 252-byte RF block from
  `bt_configure_rf.ini`, then `0xFCA1 00 00 01` (dual mode, enable). `tools/bt-init/mu300-bt-init.c` does this. Without the
  PSKey upload the controller reports a fixed placeholder address.
* The firmware advertises Hold Mode and Park State in its LMP features, but `Write Default Link Policy Settings` returns
  `Invalid HCI Command Parameters` for any value that includes them (0x0000/0x0001/0x0004/0x0005 accepted, 0x0007 rejected).
  The 5.4 kernel sets every advertised mode, so the init sequence aborts and `hciconfig hci0 up` fails with `EINVAL`.
  `kernel/patches/bluetooth-marlin3-link-policy.patch` requests only Role Switch and Sniff (Bluetooth is built in, so this
  needs the kernel rebuild).
* Android keeps the real BT address in `/data/vendor/bluetooth/btmac.txt` on encrypted `/data`; Linux uses
  `BDADDR=` from `/etc/mu300/bluetooth.conf` or a stable locally administered address derived from `machine-id`.
* Verified: `bluetoothd` powers the adapter and LE/BR-EDR scanning lists nearby devices.
* Rebuilding with a modified tree appends `-dirty` to the kernel release and breaks module loading; `.scmversion` with
  `-gb50db5b6224c` in the source tree keeps the release string stable.
